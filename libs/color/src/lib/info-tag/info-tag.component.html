<!-- USE CASE: CONFIGURATION OF A SHARED SERVICE

Our use case: we want to configure our shared component based on the app it is used in:
- Red: red product costs X EUR. Please visit www.red-products.com for more information
- Blue: blue product costs XX EUR. Please visit www.blue-products.com for more information
PROBLEM: How to keep your app and shared components loosly coupled?
SOLUTION: InjectionToken!

PRO:
- Shared configuration for everything - components, services etc.
- Service configuration (no @Input available)
CONTRA:
- Input/Output is still a valid option
- should be well documented (implicit deps)
